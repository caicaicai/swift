A Swift Tour
Tradition suggests that the first program in a new language should print the words “Hello,
world” on the screen. In Swift, this can be done in a single line:

	println("Hello, world")

If you have written code in C or Objective-C, this syntax looks familiar to you—in Swift,
this line of code is a complete program. You don’t need to import a separate library for
functionality like input/output or string handling. Code written at global scope is used as
the entry point for the program, so you don’t need a main function. You also don’t need to
write semicolons at the end of every statement.
This tour gives you enough information to start writing code in Swift by showing you how
to accomplish a variety of programming tasks. Don’t worry if you don’t understand
something—everything introduced in this tour is explained in detail in the rest of this
book.
