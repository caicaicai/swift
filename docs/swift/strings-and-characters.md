# Strings and Characters

- [Introduction](#introduction)

Strings and Characters
A string is an ordered collection of characters, such as "hello, world" or "albatross". Swift strings
are represented by the String type, which in turn represents a collection of values of Character
type.
Swift’s String and Character types provide a fast, Unicode-compliant way to work with text in
your code. The syntax for string creation and manipulation is lightweight and readable,
with a similar syntax to C strings. String concatenation is as simple as adding together
two strings with the + operator, and string mutability is managed by choosing between a
constant or a variable, just like any other value in Swift.
Despite this simplicity of syntax, Swift’s String type is a fast, modern string implementation.
Every string is composed of encoding-independent Unicode characters, and provides
support for accessing those characters in various Unicode representations.
Strings can also be used to insert constants, variables, literals, and expressions into
longer strings, in a process known as string interpolation. This makes it easy to create
custom string values for display, storage, and printing.

Swift’s String type is bridged seamlessly to Foundation’s NSString class. If you are working with the Foundation
framework in Cocoa or Cocoa Touch, the entire NSString API is available to call on any String value you create,
in addition to the String features described in this chapter. You can also use a String value with any API that
requires an NSString instance.
For more information about using String with Foundation and Cocoa, see Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-
C.
String Literals
You can include predefined String values within your code as string literals. A string literal is
a fixed sequence of textual characters surrounded by a pair of double quotes ("").
A string literal can be used to provide an initial value for a constant or variable:
let someString = "Some string literal value"
Note that Swift infers a type of String for the someString constant, because it is initialized with
a string literal value.
String literals can include the following special characters:
The code below shows an example of each kind of special character. The wiseWords
constant contains two escaped double quote characters. The dollarSign, blackHeart, and
sparklingHeart constants demonstrate the three different Unicode scalar character formats:
let wiseWords = "\"Imagination is more important than knowledge\" - Einstein"
// "Imagination is more important than knowledge" - Einstein
let dollarSign = "\x24" // $, Unicode scalar U+0024
let blackHeart = "\u2665" // ♥, Unicode scalar U+2665
let sparklingHeart = "\U0001F496" // 􀀀, Unicode scalar U+1F496
Initializing an Empty String
To create an empty String value as the starting point for building a longer string, either
assign an empty string literal to a variable, or initialize a new String instance with initializer
syntax:
var emptyString = "" // empty string literal
var anotherEmptyString = String() // initializer syntax
// these two strings are both empty, and are equivalent to each other
You can find out whether a String value is empty by checking its Boolean isEmpty property:
if emptyString.isEmpty {
println("Nothing to see here")
}
The escaped special characters \0 (null character), \\ (backslash), \t (horizontal
tab), \n (line feed), \r (carriage return), \" (double quote) and \' (single quote)
Single-byte Unicode scalars, written as \xnn, where nn is two hexadecimal digits
Two-byte Unicode scalars, written as \unnnn, where nnnn is four hexadecimal digits
Four-byte Unicode scalars, written as \Unnnnnnnn, where nnnnnnnn is eight
hexadecimal digits
// prints "Nothing to see here"
String Mutability
You indicate whether a particular String can be modified (or mutated) by assigning it to a
variable (in which case it can be modified), or to a constant (in which case it cannot be
modified):
var variableString = "Horse"
variableString += " and carriage"
// variableString is now "Horse and carriage"
let constantString = "Highlander"
constantString += " and another Highlander"
// this reports a compile-time error - a constant string cannot be modified
N O T E
This approach is different from string mutation in Objective-C and Cocoa, where you choose between two
classes (NSString and NSMutableString) to indicate whether a string can be mutated.
Strings Are Value Types
Swift’s String type is a value type. If you create a new String value, that String value is copied
when it is passed to a function or method, or when it is assigned to a constant or
variable. In each case, a new copy of the existing String value is created, and the new copy
is passed or assigned, not the original version. Value types are described in Structures
and Enumerations Are Value Types.
N O T E
This behavior differs from that of NSString in Cocoa. When you create an NSString instance in Cocoa, and
pass it to a function or method or assign it to a variable, you are always passing or assigning a reference to
the same single NSString. No copying of the string takes place, unless you specifically request it.
Swift’s copy-by-default String behavior ensures that when a function or method passes you
a String value, it is clear that you own that exact String value, regardless of where it came
from. You can be confident that the string you are passed will not be modified unless you
modify it yourself.
Behind the scenes, Swift’s compiler optimizes string usage so that actual copying takes
place only when absolutely necessary. This means you always get great performance
when working with strings as value types.
Working with Characters
Swift’s String type represents a collection of Character values in a specified order. Each
Character value represents a single Unicode character. You can access the individual Character
values in a string by iterating over that string with a for-in loop:
for character in "Dog!􀀀" {
println(character)
}
// D
// o
// g
// !
// 􀀀
The for-in loop is described in For Loops.
Alternatively, create a stand-alone Character constant or variable from a single-character
string literal by providing a Character type annotation:
let yenSign: Character = "¥"
Counting Characters
To retrieve a count of the characters in a string, call the global countElements function and
pass in a string as the function’s sole parameter:
let unusualMenagerie = "Koala 􀀀, Snail 􀀀, Penguin 􀀀, Dromedary 􀀀"
println("unusualMenagerie has \(countElements(unusualMenagerie)) characters")
// prints "unusualMenagerie has 40 characters"
N O T E
Different Unicode characters and different representations of the same Unicode character can require different
amounts of memory to store. Because of this, characters in Swift do not each take up the same amount of
memory within a string’s representation. As a result, the length of a string cannot be calculated without
iterating through the string to consider each of its characters in turn. If you are working with particularly long
string values, be aware that the countElements function must iterate over the characters within a string in
order to calculate an accurate character count for that string.
Note also that the character count returned by countElements is not always the same as the length property
of an NSString that contains the same characters. The length of an NSString is based on the number of 16-bit
code units within the string’s UTF-16 representation and not the number of Unicode characters within the
string. To reflect this fact, the length property from NSString is called utf16count when it is accessed on a Swift
String value.
Concatenating Strings and Characters
String and Character values can be added together (or concatenated) with the addition
operator (+) to create a new String value:
let string1 = "hello"
let string2 = " there"
let character1: Character = "!"
let character2: Character = "?"
let stringPlusCharacter = string1 + character1 // equals "hello!"
let stringPlusString = string1 + string2 // equals "hello there"
let characterPlusString = character1 + string1 // equals "!hello"
let characterPlusCharacter = character1 + character2 // equals "!?"
You can also append a String or Character value to an existing String variable with the addition
assignment operator (+=):
var instruction = "look over"
instruction += string2
// instruction now equals "look over there"
var welcome = "good morning"
welcome += character1
// welcome now equals "good morning!"
N O T E
You can’t append a String or Character to an existing Character variable, because a Character value must
contain a single character only.
String Interpolation
String interpolation is a way to construct a new String value from a mix of constants,
variables, literals, and expressions by including their values inside a string literal. Each
item that you insert into the string literal is wrapped in a pair of parentheses, prefixed by
a backslash:
let multiplier = 3
let message = "\(multiplier) times 2.5 is \(Double(multiplier) * 2.5)"
// message is "3 times 2.5 is 7.5"
In the example above, the value of multiplier is inserted into a string literal as \(multiplier). This
placeholder is replaced with the actual value of multiplier when the string interpolation is
evaluated to create an actual string.
The value of multiplier is also part of a larger expression later in the string. This expression
calculates the value of Double(multiplier) * 2.5 and inserts the result (7.5) into the string. In this
case, the expression is written as \(Double(multiplier) * 2.5) when it is included inside the string
literal.
N O T E
The expressions you write inside parentheses within an interpolated string cannot contain an unescaped double
quote (") or backslash (\), and cannot contain a carriage return or line feed.
Comparing Strings
Swift provides three ways to compare String values: string equality, prefix equality, and
suffix equality.
String Equality
Two String values are considered equal if they contain exactly the same characters in the
same order:
let quotation = "We're a lot alike, you and I."
let sameQuotation = "We're a lot alike, you and I."
if quotation == sameQuotation {
println("These two strings are considered equal")
}
// prints "These two strings are considered equal"
Prefix and Suffix Equality
To check whether a string has a particular string prefix or suffix, call the string’s hasPrefix
and hasSuffix methods, both of which take a single argument of type String and return a
Boolean value. Both methods perform a character-by-character comparison between the
base string and the prefix or suffix string.
The examples below consider an array of strings representing the scene locations from
the first two acts of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet:
let romeoAndJuliet = [
"Act 1 Scene 1: Verona, A public place",
"Act 1 Scene 2: Capulet's mansion",
"Act 1 Scene 3: A room in Capulet's mansion",
"Act 1 Scene 4: A street outside Capulet's mansion",
"Act 1 Scene 5: The Great Hall in Capulet's mansion",
"Act 2 Scene 1: Outside Capulet's mansion",
"Act 2 Scene 2: Capulet's orchard",
"Act 2 Scene 3: Outside Friar Lawrence's cell",
Act 2 Scene 4: A street in Verona",
Act 2 Scene 5: Capulet's mansion",
Act 2 Scene 6: Friar Lawrence's cell"
You can use the hasPrefix method with the romeoAndJuliet array to count the number of scenes
in Act 1 of the play:
var act1SceneCount = 0
for scene in romeoAndJuliet {
if scene.hasPrefix("Act 1 ") {
++act1SceneCount
}
}
println("There are \(act1SceneCount) scenes in Act 1")
// prints "There are 5 scenes in Act 1"
Similarly, use the hasSuffix method to count the number of scenes that take place in or
around Capulet’s mansion and Friar Lawrence’s cell:
var mansionCount = 0
var cellCount = 0
for scene in romeoAndJuliet {
if scene.hasSuffix("Capulet's mansion") {
++mansionCount
} else if scene.hasSuffix("Friar Lawrence's cell") {
++cellCount
}
}
("\(mansionCount) mansion scenes; \(cellCount) cell scenes")
prints "6 mansion scenes; 2 cell scenes"
Uppercase and Lowercase Strings
You can access an uppercase or lowercase version of a string with its uppercaseString and
lowercaseString properties:
let normal = "Could you help me, please?"
let shouty = normal.uppercaseString
// shouty is equal to "COULD YOU HELP ME, PLEASE?"
let whispered = normal.lowercaseString
// whispered is equal to "could you help me, please?"
Unicode
Unicode is an international standard for encoding and representing text. It enables you to
represent almost any character from any language in a standardized form, and to read
and write those characters to and from an external source such as a text file or web page.
Swift’s String and Character types are fully Unicode-compliant. They support a number of
different Unicode encodings, as described below.
Unicode Terminology
Every character in Unicode can be represented by one or more unicode scalars. A unicode
scalar is a unique 21-bit number (and name) for a character or modifier, such as U+0061 for
LOWERCASE LATIN LETTER A ("a"), or U+1F425 for FRONT-FACING BABY CHICK ("􀀀").
When a Unicode string is written to a text file or some other storage, these unicode
scalars are encoded in one of several Unicode-defined formats. Each format encodes the
string in small chunks known as code units. These include the UTF-8 format (which
encodes a string as 8-bit code units) and the UTF-16 format (which encodes a string as
16-bit code units).
Unicode Representations of Strings
Swift provides several different ways to access Unicode representations of strings.
You can iterate over the string with a for-in statement, to access its individual Character
values as Unicode characters. This process is described in Working with Characters.
Alternatively, access a String value in one of three other Unicode-compliant
representations:
Each example below shows a different representation of the following string, which is
made up of the characters D, o, g, !, and the 􀀀 character ( DOG FACE, or Unicode scalar
U+1F436):
let dogString = "Dog!􀀀"
UTF-8
You can access a UTF-8 representation of a String by iterating over its utf8 property. This
property is of type UTF8View, which is a collection of unsigned 8-bit (UInt8) values, one for
each byte in the string’s UTF-8 representation:
for codeUnit in dogString.utf8 {
print("\(codeUnit) ")
}
print("\n")
// 68 111 103 33 240 159 144 182
In the example above, the first four decimal codeUnit values (68, 111, 103, 33) represent the
characters D, o, g, and !, whose UTF-8 representation is the same as their ASCII
representation. The last four codeUnit values (240, 159, 144, 182) are a four-byte UTF-8
representation of the DOG FACE character.
UTF-16
A collection of UTF-8 code units (accessed with the string’s utf8 property)
A collection of UTF-16 code units (accessed with the string’s utf16 property)
A collection of 21-bit Unicode scalar values (accessed with the string’s unicodeScalars
property)
You can access a UTF-16 representation of a String by iterating over its utf16 property. This
property is of type UTF16View, which is a collection of unsigned 16-bit (UInt16) values, one for
each 16-bit code unit in the string’s UTF-16 representation:
for codeUnit in dogString.utf16 {
print("\(codeUnit) ")
}
print("\n")
// 68 111 103 33 55357 56374
Again, the first four codeUnit values (68, 111, 103, 33) represent the characters D, o, g, and !,
whose UTF-16 code units have the same values as in the string’s UTF-8 representation.
The fifth and sixth codeUnit values (55357 and 56374) are a UTF-16 surrogate pair
representation of the DOG FACE character. These values are a lead surrogate value of
U+D83D (decimal value 55357) and a trail surrogate value of U+DC36 (decimal value 56374).
Unicode Scalars
You can access a Unicode scalar representation of a String value by iterating over its
unicodeScalars property. This property is of type UnicodeScalarView, which is a collection of values
of type UnicodeScalar. A Unicode scalar is any 21-bit Unicode code point that is not a lead
surrogate or trail surrogate code point.
Each UnicodeScalar has a value property that returns the scalar’s 21-bit value, represented
within a UInt32 value:
for scalar in dogString.unicodeScalars {
print("\(scalar.value) ")
}
print("\n")
// 68 111 103 33 128054
The value properties for the first four UnicodeScalar values (68, 111, 103, 33) once again
represent the characters D, o, g, and !. The value property of the fifth and final UnicodeScalar,
128054, is a decimal equivalent of the hexadecimal value 1F436, which is equivalent to the
Unicode scalar U+1F436 for the DOG FACE character.
As an alternative to querying their value properties, each UnicodeScalar value can also be used
to construct a new String value, such as with string interpolation:
for scalar in dogString.unicodeScalars {
println("\(scalar) ")
}
// D
// o
// g
// !
// 􀀀
